The Alas plan file is a Markdown text file with a special format. So, you can
use any text editor to edit the file, such as Vim, Emacs, Nano, TextMate or
VS Code.

It can be convenient to use a plugin for your editor that supports checking and
unchecking tasks (`[ ]`, `[X]`), such as [Vimwiki](https://vimwiki.github.io/)
or [kakoune-wiki](https://github.com/TeddyDD/kakoune-wiki).

Note that you can use the Alas format for your plan even without the Alas
CLI tool.
